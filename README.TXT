PROJECT TITLE:
Evacuation Simulation System

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
This project simulates a school evacuation scenario using Java Swing. It visualizes student movement during emergencies such as evacuations, lunch breaks, and Panther Time. The simulation tracks congestion levels, displays the flow of students, and helps identify problem areas such as crowded exits or stairs.

VERSION or DATE:
Version 1.0
Date: March 2025

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
Download the project files from the GitHub repository.
Open the project in BlueJ (or any Java IDE that supports Swing).
Run the main class to launch the evacuation simulation.

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
When the program runs, students will randomly spawn in different areas of the school.
The movement of students toward evacuation zones (like stairs and the field) is simulated.
The program uses a linked list to manage the movement of students and their attributes.
To reset the simulation, click the "Reset" button to reinitialize the student movement and data.
